When I was a Business student I realized how important and powerful statistics were to support strategic decisions and manage the risks associated with them.

This led me to continue my studies at the master's degree course in Statistical, Financial and Actuarial Sciences, where I was able to put into practice some of the most used methods in the real world, being fascinated by this so broad field.

Now I am taking my first steps in the world of data analysis and I have created this website to share my most relevant projects.
